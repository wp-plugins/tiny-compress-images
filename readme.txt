Speed up your website. Optimize your JPEG and PNG images automatically with TinyPNG.

== Description ==

Make your website faster by compressing your JPEG and PNG images.

This plugin automatically optimizes your images by integrating with the popular image compression services TinyJPG and TinyPNG.

= How does it work? =

After you upload an image to your WordPress site, each resized image is uploaded to the TinyJPG or TinyPNG service. Your image is analyzed to apply the best possible compression. Based on the content of your image an optimal strategy is chosen. The result is sent back to your WordPress site. On average JPEG images are compressed by 40-60% and PNG images by 50-80% without visible loss in quality. Your website will load faster for your visitors, and you’ll save storage space and bandwidth!

= Getting started =

Install this plugin and obtain your free API key from https://tinypng.com/developers. The first 500 compressions per month are completely free, so roughly 100 images can be uploaded to WordPress for free, no strings attached! You can also change which of the generated thumbnail sizes should be compressed, because each one of them counts as a compression. And if you’re a heavy user, you can compress additional images for a small additional fee per image.

= Multisite support =

The API key can optionally be configured in wp-config.php. This removes the need to set a key on each site individually in your multisite network.
